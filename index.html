        <h1>Ashli's Site — Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome! This is my assignment page for Unit 1. (This page, along with everything I'll submit for this class, is not 
            AI generated. I just write like that)
        </p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ashli! I'm non-binary, and my pronouns are she/they. I'm primarily a Rust developer, but I've also done work with 
            JVM languages like Kotlin, functional languages like Haskell, concatenative languages like Factor, etc. I enjoy esolangs 
            (esoteric programming languages) designed to just be weird or math-y and maybe push the bounds of what
            should even count as a language. <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bleh" target="_blank">Here</a> is one of mine! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very sensitive to like... "messy" code so-to-speak. I get very overwhelmed and demotivated by it— As such, 
            I use a lot of comments written in a tutorial-like manner to ensure I remember what and why different things exist 
            in my code.
            For HTML I'll probably not need a <i>ton</i> of comments, because most of the tags are self-describing, but I figured 
            I'd let you know in case we get into JavaScript or whatnot. (I think you mentioned we wouldn't really touch it though?) 
        </p>
        <p>
            (As a snobby Linux user, I am obligated to mention that I am a Linux user— Arch Linux no less)
        </p>

        <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I already have <i>some</i> knowledge in solo website development, I have my own site which
            is currently also hosted on GitHub pages, though it's politically charged and blocked on the school wifi.
            I've been working on migrating it to Codeberg pages, as that's where the majority of my projects, including the 
            source Svelte code, are hosted. It currently just sends the compiled code to GitHub using an npm task, but 
            it's really hacky lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned prior, I mostly use Codeberg for my repositories, not GitHub. My account can be found 
            <a href="https://codeberg.org/AshliKatt" target="_blank">here</a>. (Be warned, it's like 90% incomplete Rust projects)
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very comfortable with using basic Git actions, pushing, pulling, creating branches, merging them, rebasing, etc. 
            I worked on a team for a Minecraft server (primarily Java) for about a year so I'm adept at that kinda stuff and working 
            on a small team.
        </p>

        <h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, the boring answer is "it's required for my degree" but that's <b>LAME</b>. I believe that all classes have value and 
            that you can always get something out of them! (Even if what you get out of them is "I don't like this subject")
        </p>
        <p>
            My current knowledge of HTML and CSS are from just simple references like W3Schools and the MDN docs for my own site. But,
            of course, just looking up "how do I do X" every time I need to do X leaves significant gaps in my knowledge. It is also 
            prone to the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/" target="_blank">XY Problem</a>. Thus, having this class to fill in the inevitable, 
            huge gaps in my knowlege is immensely helpful, even if I don't often touch web-dev.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for JavaScript on the web, I'm much more confident in it as I've used it for many years with small P5js games on OpenProcessing. 
            I've also written some absolute nightmare code for my website that got lazily migrated to TypeScript when I switched to Svelte. 
            I have less experience with backend NodeJS code and such, but we're only doing static pages here so that's probably not relevant.
