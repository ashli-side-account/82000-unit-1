                    Okay so previously I used <b> and <i>, these are incorrect*, remember to use <em> and <strong> instead!
                        
                    *They're poor for accessibility, they don't properly denote that the word is emphasized or "spoken" strongly,
                    they purely just change the rendering. This might be useful for visual readability purposes, but so far I've only used
                    them for actual emphasis, thus <em> and <strong> are more suited to my use cases.

                    My name is Ashli! I'm non-binary and my pronouns are she/they.

                    My main interest is computer science and (to a slightly lesser extent) programming. In terms of the latter, I've 
                    used a variety of languages, from Kotlin to Factor to Haskell to JavaScript to Bash. My experience and comfort
                    varies, naturally, but Rust has been a stand-out favorite language of mine and is what I write the majority of my 
                    code in.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the biggest areas of programming that I enjoy is <em>language design</em>. I love writing compilers, interpreters,
                    even just parsers or lexers. One of my <a href="https://codeberg.org/AshliKatt/Alkale" target="_blank">largest projects</a>
                    is indeed just a lexer library.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With regard to compilers, I've enjoyed <em>esoteric programming languages</em> for a long time— both reading others'
                    work and making my own! In particular I enjoy math-heavy languages or ones that force you to think outside of the box
                    to use— I like a good puzzle! The language I'm most proud of making is 
                    <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bleh" target="_blank">Bleh</a>, a language of mine based on bitstrings and pattern 
                    matching (incredible name, I know).

                <h2>Prior Experience</h2>

                <p>
                    I already have <em>some</em> knowledge in solo website development, I have my own site which is currently hosted 
                    on Codeberg Pages, though it's a bit politically charged. It was initially written in raw HTML, CSS, and JS, but 
                    I've switched to using Svelte with Scss and TypeScript as the codebase has grown. (Though I'm planning on migrating 
                    it further into a custom language I'm working on because I have an insatiatble need to build everything myself)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned, I mostly use Codeberg for my repositories, not GitHub. My account can be found 
                    <a href="https://codeberg.org/AshliKatt" target="_blank">here</a>. A majority of my repositories are just unfinished Rust
                    projects, however. Mostly compilers or interpreters.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Additionally, I used to be a volunteer developer on Minecraft server focused on teaching basic programming, (akin to Scratch)
                    so I'm fairly adept at working with others and using Git. (at least in a small, informal team)
                </p>

                <h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Well, the boring answer is "it's required for my degree" but that's a bit of a cop-out. All educational experiences 
                    have value and you can pretty much always get something out of a class like this! Whether I'm actually a web developer or
                    not is irrelevant, learning is good!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My current knowledge of HTML and CSS are from just simple references like W3Schools and the MDN docs for developing my 
                    own site. But, of course, just looking up "how do I do X in CSS" every time I need to do X leaves <strong>significant</strong> 
                    gaps in my knowledge. It is also prone to the <a href="https://xyproblem.info/" target="_blank">XY Problem</a>. Thus, 
                    having this class to fill in the inevitable, huge gaps in my knowlege is very helpful!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As for JavaScript, on the other hand, I'm much more confident in it than I am with HTML/CSS. I've used it for over 4 
                    years in several different environments, including, of course, frontend website development. I feel like most of my 
                    knowledge gain at the point would be more on the practical side of things, such as learning new libraries or standard modules 
                    or whatnot. But, of course, JavaScript is full of obscure, disgusting features (like the whole raw-string function call syntax) 
                    so I'm certain I have gaps there too.
