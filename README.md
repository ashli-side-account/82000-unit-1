# 82000 - Unit 1
This is my main project for Unit 1 (Assignment 1?)

## About
This assignment is about showing that we understand the basic workflow of Git, our code editor, and simple HTML. This project has a GH Pages site, which may be found [here](https://ashli-side-account.github.io/82000-unit-1/).

The actual content of this site is kind of irrelevant, it's just me rambling to have *something* to display.
